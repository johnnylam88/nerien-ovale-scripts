**Nerien's Ovale Scripts** installs a new set of default class scripts for users of [Ovale Spell Priority](http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/ovale).  These scripts are based on [SimulationCraft](http://code.google.com/p/simulationcraft/) and are meant to be used in live raiding scenarios where the player must make the important choices in the rotation.  Each script creates at least two primary icons:

- **Main Rotation Icon**: shows how to maximize DPS without the use of any cooldown abilities
- **Cooldown Icon**: suggests cooldowns or other situational abilities that can be applied at the current time

Each class script may also have additional icons for other class-specific information, e.g., to suggest dumping rage using [Heroic Strike](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=78) as a warrior or [Maul](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6807) as a bear druid.  Each class script will also suggest maintaining self buffs, e.g., [Arcane Brilliance](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1459), [Mark of the Wild](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1126), etc., and raid buffs and debuffs, e.g., [Critical Mass](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=22959), [Curse of the Elements](http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1490), etc.

### How to Use ###

Simply install Nerien's Ovale Scripts like any other addon.  This addon works by adjusting in-game what Ovale thinks are the default class scripts, so there is no additional configuration.

If you have a custom script pasted into the code window, then click the button to "Restore default".

### Status ###

The script for each specialization of each class is marked as either Experimental or **Tested** in a raid environment.  If a class specialization is not listed, then it has not yet been implemented.
