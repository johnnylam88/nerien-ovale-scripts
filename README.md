**Nerien's Ovale Scripts** is a script manager for [Ovale Spell Priority][ovale].  The user can choose a default script for the current class from amongst a collection of scripts contributed by other users.

  [ovale]: http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/ovale

These scripts are meant to be used in live raiding scenarios where the player must make the important choices in the rotation.  Each script creates at least two primary icons:

- **Main Rotation Icon**: shows how to maximize DPS without the use of any cooldown abilities
- **Cooldown Icon**: suggests cooldowns or other situational abilities that can be applied at the current time

Each class script may also have additional icons for other class-specific information, e.g., to suggest dumping rage using [Heroic Strike][] as a warrior or [Savage Defense][] as a bear druid.  Each class script may also suggest maintaining self buffs, e.g., [Arcane Brilliance][], [Mark of the Wild][], etc., and raid buffs and debuffs, e.g., [Curse of the Elements][], etc.
