# Nerien's Ovale Scripts #

### Nerien's Ovale Scripts is returning for Shadowlands! ###

**Nerien's Ovale Scripts** is a script collection for [Ovale Spell Priority].
The scripts are my interpretations of the advice from [Wowhead], [Icy Veins], and class [Discord] servers.

  [Ovale Spell Priority]: https://github.com/Sidoine/Ovale
  [Wowhead]: https://www.wowhead.com/classes
  [Icy Veins]: https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides
  [Discord]: https://www.wowhead.com/discord-servers#class-discord-servers

Each script uses the following general icon layout:

- **Short Cooldowns**: short (generally under 1 minute) cooldown abilities
- **Main Rotation**: main abilities for single-target situations
- **AoE Rotation**: AoE abilities for multi-target situations
- **Long Cooldowns**: long (generally longer than 1 minute) cooldown abilities

Install **Nerien's Ovale Scripts** like any other addon.
Open up the **Ovale** code window and select the script you would like to use for the current profile.
